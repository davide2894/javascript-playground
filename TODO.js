    Now the problem of the day :grinning:
    
    write a function that takes two arguments,the first represents a flattened array and the second is a number

    the function should covert the the array to a Two dimensional one, every array inside have a length equal to the number that passed as argument if there are still excess elements

    For example

    grouping([1,2,3,4,5,6],3);  // [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
    grouping([6,8,10,15,4],2) //  [[6,8],[10,15],[4]]
    grouping([12,8,15,20,38,40,60],7) // [[12,8,15,20,38,40,60]]

    Hi my dear friends :slightly_smiling_face: again

    Now the problem of the day :grinning:

    Incomplete sum
    Write a function that takes an array of numbers as argument and return the sum of the largest and smallest numbers and all numbers in between except other numbers found in the array

    For example

    incompleteSum([2,3,5])   // 11
    incompleteSum([3,6,2,1,4]); // 12
    incompleteSum([1,3,5,10]); //47
